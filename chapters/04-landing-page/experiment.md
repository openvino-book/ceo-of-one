# Chapter 4 Experiment: Building the Real Training Camp Landing Page

## Objective

This is not a comparison experiment. It's a **real product build** demonstrating the full CEO of One workflow in action: one sentence from the CEO → COO decomposition → engineer execution → production-ready output.

## Setup

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| **CEO Input** | One sentence: "帮我搭建 CEO of One 训练营的官网首页。" |
| **COO (OpenClaw)** | Decomposed into tech stack, design specs, sections, and acceptance criteria |
| **Engineer (Claude Code)** | Built the entire page via acpx in a single session |
| **Tech Stack** | Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS |
| **Duration** | ~10 minutes |

## Process

### Step 1: CEO — One Sentence

The CEO issued a single Chinese sentence requesting the landing page. No specs, no mockups, no follow-up.

### Step 2: COO — Decomposition

OpenClaw decomposed the request into a complete build plan:

- **Tech stack:** Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **9 page sections:** Nav, Hero, Pain Points, Solution, Course Outline, Social Proof, Pricing, FAQ, Footer
- **Design specs:** Dark theme (#0a0a0a bg, #1a1a2e cards, #6366f1 accent), responsive layout
- **10 acceptance criteria:** build pass, lint clean, no TODO/FIXME/console.log, all sections present, responsive, FAQ accordion, sticky nav, etc.

### Step 3: Engineer — Build

Claude Code received the plan and built the entire page in one pass — two source files totaling 389 lines.

## Results

| Criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| `npm run build` | ✅ Zero errors |
| `npm run lint` | ✅ Zero warnings |
| No TODO/FIXME/console.log | ✅ Clean |
| All 9 sections | ✅ Implemented |
| Dark theme | ✅ #0a0a0a / #1a1a2e / #6366f1 |
| Responsive (mobile + desktop) | ✅ |
| FAQ accordion | ✅ Click to expand/collapse |
| Sticky navigation | ✅ |

**Deliverable:** 2 source files (`layout.tsx` 362 lines + `page.tsx` 27 lines), production-ready on first attempt.

## Key Insights

**1. One sentence → production page.** The CEO provided zero technical detail. The COO's decomposition bridge turned that ambiguity into a precise build plan. This is the core value proposition of the CEO of One method.

**2. Decomposition is the bottleneck, not coding.** Claude Code built the page in minutes because the requirements were already unambiguous. The COO's work (section definition, design specs, acceptance criteria) was what made this possible.

**3. Acceptance criteria prevent quality collapse.** Without the "no TODO, no console.log, build+lint must pass" checks, the page would likely have shipped with developer leftovers. These constraints cost nothing to define and saved a review cycle.

**4. Self-referential proof.** The landing page you see at the end of this chapter *is* the artifact built during this experiment. Readers are looking at the real output of the method the book teaches — not a mockup, not a demo.

**5. 10 minutes, 1 sentence, 389 lines.** That's the ROI number. A human team would have required a kickoff meeting, design mockup, frontend implementation, review, and revision — spanning days. The AI team did it in the time it takes to drink coffee.

## What This Proves

The CEO of One model isn't theoretical. It's a repeatable process:
1. You say what you want (1 sentence).
2. Your AI COO turns it into a plan (decomposition).
3. Your AI engineer builds it (execution).
4. Automated checks validate quality (acceptance criteria).

The method scales beyond landing pages — the same flow applies to backend services, mobile apps, documentation, and more. But this experiment proves the baseline: **a solo human with AI team members can ship real products at real speed.**
