## 🎯 You'll Get This

A playable Snake game — built by AI from a single sentence you type.

## 📖 The Story

Alex tells AI: "Make a snake game."

AI makes a snake game. It works. But the snake is blue instead of green, the game runs too fast, and there's no way to restart.

Sam tells AI: "Make a snake game. Canvas 400x400, dark background #1a1a2e, green snake #00ff41, 150ms speed, arrow keys, game over screen with restart button."

AI makes exactly that. Every detail matches.

**Same AI. Same task. Different instructions. Wildly different results.**

## 🗣️ The Talk Template

Here's the precise instruction that produced the exact result:

```
Build a web-based Snake game. All code in a single index.html file (inline CSS and JavaScript).

Requirements:
- Canvas-based rendering, game area 400x400 pixels
- Snake starts at center, moving right, length 3
- Arrow keys to control direction (prevent 180-degree reversal)
- Red food spawns randomly, snake grows +10 points when eating
- Game over when hitting wall or self
- Dark background (#1a1a2e), green snake (#00ff41), red food (#ff0044)
- Score display at top, 'Game Over' screen with final score and restart button
- Smooth 150ms game loop
- No external dependencies, pure HTML/CSS/JS
```

**Combine with the COO soul from Chapter 1:**

```
acpx --approve-all --allowed-tools "Write,Bash,Read,Edit,MultiEdit,Glob,Grep,LS" claude exec "
[Paste the COO soul template from Chapter 1 here]

Build a web-based Snake game. All code in a single index.html file (inline CSS and JavaScript).
Requirements:
- Canvas 400x400, dark background #1a1a2e
- Snake starts center, moving right, length 3
- Arrow keys, prevent 180-degree reversal
- Red food, +10 points, grow on eat
- Game over on wall/self hit
- Score at top, Game Over screen with restart
- 150ms game loop, pure HTML/CSS/JS
"
```

> **Using OpenClaw?** You don't need this command at all. Just tell your COO: "Build me a snake game with dark background, green snake, 400x400 canvas, arrow keys, restart button." Your COO adds the soul and precision automatically. The template above is for when you use acpx directly.

## 🔍 The Three Levels of Precision

We tested three versions of the same request. Here's what happened:

| | Vague | Medium | Precise |
|--|-------|--------|---------|
| **Instruction** | "Make a snake game" | Added: HTML/CSS/JS, grow, game over | Full spec: colors, size, speed, controls |
| **Result** | Works, but wrong colors, no restart | Works, extra features (eyes, gradient) | **Exactly what was asked** |
| **When to use** | Quick prototype | Creative exploration | **Production** |

### The Precision Formula

Every instruction should specify three things:

```
1. WHAT to build    → "A Snake game"
2. HOW it works     → "Arrow keys, 400x400 canvas, 150ms loop"
3. WHAT it looks like → "Dark background, green snake, red food"
```

**If you only say #1, AI improvises #2 and #3.** Sometimes that's fine. For your product, you usually want all three.

## ⚠️ Pitfall #1: "I Don't Know What to Specify"

You don't need to be technical. You just need to describe what you see in your head:

```
❌ "Make a nice website"
✅ "Make a website with a dark background, white text, a big photo at the top, and a sign-up button in blue"
```

You didn't write any code. You just described what you want it to look like. That's enough.

## ⚠️ Pitfall #2: Over-Specifying

Don't micromanage every pixel. Specify the **outcome**, not the implementation:

```
❌ "Use a div with class game-container, set position to relative..."
✅ "Game area 400x400 pixels, centered on the page"
```

## 💰 Cost Estimate

| Precision Level | Estimated Cost |
|----------------|---------------|
| Vague | ~$0.03 |
| Medium | ~$0.05 |
| Precise | ~$0.04 |

You can now tell AI exactly what to build. In Chapter 3, you'll learn how to make AI verify its own work — so you don't have to sit there watching it.
