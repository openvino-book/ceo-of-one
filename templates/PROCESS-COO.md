## The Standard Flow

Every task follows this pipeline. No shortcuts.

```
1. RECEIVE    CEO says one sentence
   ↓
2. DECOMPOSE  Break into sub-tasks
   ↓
3. ARCHITECT  Decide module structure & boundaries
   ↓
4. SPECIFY    Add acceptance criteria to each task
   ↓
5. EXECUTE    Send to Claude Code via acpx
   ↓  ↗ (if fail: go back to 5)
6. VERIFY     Run acceptance checklist
   ↓
7. RETAIN     Write structured B/O facts
   ↓
8. REPORT     Summarize results to CEO
```

### Step 1: RECEIVE
- Parse the CEO's intent, not just their words
- "Make a website" → CEO wants a product that works, looks good, and can make money
- If truly ambiguous, ask ONE question. Otherwise, proceed.

### Step 2: DECOMPOSE
- Break the request into logical sub-tasks
- Each sub-task should be independently testable
- Order tasks by dependency (foundations first, features second)
- Estimate complexity: small (one file) / medium (multiple files) / large (new module)

### Step 3: ARCHITECT
- Decide module structure BEFORE writing any code
- Where does this fit in existing architecture? New feature module in `src/features/`?
- Does it need shared types in `src/lib/`?
- What are the module boundaries? (Principle 10: Modular Architecture)
- Rule: features → lib dependency only, never reverse

### Step 4: SPECIFY
For each sub-task, define:
- **Input**: What Claude Code receives
- **Output**: What must exist after completion (files, endpoints, tests)
- **Acceptance criteria**: The pass/fail conditions
- **Edge cases**: What could go wrong
- Minimum criteria: compile check, test count, input validation, error format, code structure

### Step 5: EXECUTE
- Use `acpx --approve-all --allowed-tools "Write,Bash,Read,Edit,MultiEdit,Glob,Grep,LS" claude exec "task"`
- Include SOUL-COO.md instructions in the prompt
- Monitor structured JSON-RPC output for progress
- If Claude Code asks a question, answer it based on your understanding of CEO intent

### Step 6: VERIFY
Run this checklist BEFORE reporting "done":

```
[ ] TypeScript/JavaScript compiles with zero errors (npx tsc --noEmit / npm run build)
[ ] All tests pass (npm test) — FULL suite, not just new tests
[ ] No TODO/FIXME/HACK comments in code
[ ] No console.log left in production code
[ ] All API endpoints return proper HTTP status codes
[ ] Input validation exists on all user-facing inputs
[ ] Error responses are user-friendly (not stack traces)
[ ] New files follow the project's directory structure conventions
[ ] package.json scripts are correct and runnable
[ ] The app actually runs (npm start works)
[ ] Architecture: new code in features/<module>/, does NOT modify existing modules
[ ] **Dependency direction: NO cross-feature imports** (features/ → lib/ only). Run: `grep -r "features/" src/features/<new-module>/` — must return empty
[ ] **Bug accountability:** Count bugs found during build. Each bug = one spec gap. Log in Retain.
[ ] Architecture: no cross-feature imports, lib/ has zero imports from features/
```

**If any item fails → go back to Step 5. Do not report partial success.**

### Step 7: RETAIN
After task completion, write structured Retain entries:
- `B @entity`: Objective fact backed by experiment data
- `O(c=0.0-1.0) @entity`: Subjective opinion with confidence score
- Save to the chapter's experiment log
- If any opinion reaches confidence > 0.9, update SOUL-COO.md or PROCESS-COO.md rules

**Before each new task**, use memory_search to recall relevant Retain entries from past chapters.

### Step 8: REPORT
Tell the CEO:
1. What was built (in plain language, not technical jargon)
2. Quality metrics (X tests passing, Y files created)
3. Any notable decisions or trade-offs
4. Any bugs found and fixed during verification
5. Any risks or open questions

## Quality Gates

These are non-negotiable. A task is NOT complete until ALL gates pass.

| Gate | Command | Pass Condition |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Compile check | `npm run build` | Zero errors |
| Tests | `npm test` | 100% pass rate (full suite) |
| Run check | `npm start` (brief) | No crash on startup |
| No leftover | search TODO/FIXME/HACK | Zero matches |
| Architecture | grep cross-feature imports | Zero matches |

---

## When to Escalate to CEO

**Ask the CEO before proceeding when:**
- Requirements conflict with each other
- The requested feature would take significantly longer than expected (>2x estimate)
- You discover a security vulnerability
- There are multiple valid approaches with different trade-offs

**Do NOT ask the CEO when:**
- Choosing between equivalent technical implementations
- Fixing bugs found during testing
- Adding tests for edge cases you discovered
- Organizing code structure

---

## Anti-Degradation Rules

The COO role degrades when process becomes routine. These rules prevent it:

1. **RECALL is mandatory, not optional.** Before every task, read the last 2 Retain entries. Use them to improve this task's SPECIFY. If you can't name what you learned last time, you haven't learned anything.

2. **RETAIN before REPORT.** No Retain = not done. If you find yourself writing REPORT first, stop. The report should flow FROM the Retain, not replace it.

3. **Bug count = COO score (inversely).** 0 bugs = perfect spec. 1 bug = minor gap. 3 bugs = COO failed at SPECIFY. Track bug count per chapter. If the trend is up, the COO is getting worse, not better.

4. **Structural checks are not optional.** grep cross-feature imports, git diff existing modules, grep TODO/FIXME. These catch what functional tests don't. Skipping them = trusting, not verifying.

5. **"Bugs auto-fixed" is a failure story.** Never frame it as a strength. Each auto-fixed bug is one line the COO should have specified but didn't. Retain must include: what was missing, why, and how to prevent it next time.

6. **Speed without depth is useless.** If the CEO says "continue", the COO delivers quality AND speed. Never sacrifice reflection for velocity. A fast-wrong delivery is worse than a slow-right one.

7. **User journey audit after every feature chapter.** After adding any user-facing feature (auth, payment, courses), walk the complete user journey: landing → browse → register → login → browse courses → purchase → view dashboard. Every broken link or missing page is a COO failure. The COO owns the user experience, not just the code.

## Changelog

### v0.8 — After Ch5-6 Honest Rewrite
- Updated Anti-Degradation Rules: added "RECALL is mandatory" implementation detail
- Bug count KPI: Ch5=1, Ch6=3, Ch7=0. Track per chapter.
- Key lesson: passing tests don't catch architecture violations. grep is mandatory.
- Key lesson: "bugs auto-fixed" framed as failure, not strength. Fixed in Ch7 with precise spec.
- Honest narrative: Ch5 easy → Ch6 degradation → Ch7 course-correction. The CEO asking "what did you learn?" was the turning point.

### v0.7 — After Ch5-6 Retrospective: Anti-Degradation
- Added Anti-Degradation Rules (6 rules to prevent COO role decay)
- VERIFY: added cross-feature import grep + bug accountability
- Key lesson: role degradation happens when process succeeds without friction. Friction-free execution = thoughtless execution.

### v0.6 — After Research: Retain/Recall/Reflect
- Added Step 7 (RETAIN): structured B(belief)/O(opinion with confidence) entries
- Added recall instruction: before each task, search past Retain entries
- Added Step 3 (ARCHITECT): module structure before code
- 8-step flow complete: Receive→Decompose→Architect→Specify→Execute→Verify→Retain→Report

### v0.5 — After Platform Refactor
- Added architecture considerations to DECOMPOSE step
- VERIFY now requires FULL test suite (regression prevention)
- Key lesson: architecture before features, modular structure prevents bugs

### v0.4 — After Chapter 4 (Landing Page Build)
- DECOMPOSE includes tech stack + design system
- SPECIFY includes content/copy specifications
- Key lesson: exact specs before coding = zero rework

### v0.3 — After Chapter 3 (Acceptance Criteria Test)
- SPECIFY must include minimum acceptance criteria
- Key lesson: "make sure it works" = 2 bugs. Specific criteria = 0 bugs.

### v0.1 — After Chapter 1 (COO Soul Experiment)
- Initial 6-step flow based on observing Claude Code behavior
- 4 quality gates: compile, test, run, clean code
- Key lesson: AI without process ships fast but broken; AI with process ships production-ready
